# oak Change Log

## Version 12.1.0

- refactor: use `KeyStack` from std (d2eff20)

  oak contributed `KeyStack` to the Deno std library, and is now migrating to
  that.

- refactor: migrate to `SecureCookieMap` from std (b136fdc)

  oak contributed its cookie management to the Deno std library, and is now
  migrating to that.

## Version 12.0.1

- fix: decode empty request bodies for JSON as null (fa98626)
- fix: handle throwing in context construction (ba9b7cc)
- fix: send() doesn't set content-length header (b62de95)

## Version 12.0.0

- feat: `Router.prototype.all` uses all methods (4ddc851)

  **BREAKING** when using `Router.prototype.all()` to register middleware, it
  will now use all the methods (except `OPTIONS`) to register the middleware
  instead of an arbitrary set of common methods.

- fix: use null prototype with cookie match cache (798eca7)
- fix: `Router.prototype.all` omit `OPTIONS` method (98067a4)
- fix: use `"Allow"` versus `"Allowed"` header for `OPTIONS` (3bcd4eb)
- fix: update types for TypeScript 4.9 (31a1c7f)
- fix: save route name during route matching (#574)
- fix: zero `content-length` triggering max body size error (#552)
- fix: remove unused function from flash server (01264e6)
- chore: fix node tests (5ea9729)
- chore: update checkout action (811e0ea)
- chore: lint (b2a7356)

## Version 11.1.0

- feat: provide options for JSON replacing and reviving (855ecf0)

  You can now set `jsonBodyReplacer` and `jsonBodyReviver` to assist when
  automatic decoding of JSON bodies in requests or responses occur. This allows
  custom logic to achieve things like handling bigints, circular references, and
  custom serialization of things like `RegExp`.

- fix: add missing generic parameters for multiple middlewares (#549)
- fix: refactor flash to align to Deno 1.25 release (f3976fc)
- fix: add flash support to staticServer example (48130a2)
- docs: repoint doc URL to just deno.land/x (8237e7a)

## Version 11.0.0

- feat: make overriding router parameter types easier (#513)

  When route type inference breaks down, it was previously difficult to provide
  a different set of asserted route parameters. This now makes it easier.

- feat: support Deno's experimental flash server (#545)

  As of this release Deno canary includes the experimental flash HTTP server
  which dramatically increases performance when running in Deno CLI. It is
  expected to ship as unstable in Deno 1.25. See the README and module doc for
  information on how to enable the flash server.

  oak's support for flash is also experimental at this point.

- refactor: update deps, migrate more to std/http

  Much of the common parts of oak have been being contributed back to `std/http`
  and refactoring to support this migration is underway. Because there are
  likely to be minor and subtle differences in how things operate, this release
  of oak is a major release. I am not currently aware of any major breaking
  changes, but wanted to ensure that people were consciously aware.

- feat: support CJS for npm package (2f38652)

  The npm distribution now includes ESM and CJS modules, enabling oak to be
  imported with `require()` in Node.js.

- refactor: remove dynamic import (e776011)

## Version 10.3.0

- feat: add experimental support for Node.js (#479)

  oak is now available as an Node.js npm package: `@oakserver/oak`. See

- chore: add bundling tests (50f311e)

## Version 10.0.0

- feat: remove `std/http` and `std/ws` (#408)

  **BREAKING CHANGE**

  All HTTP native server implementations have been stabilized in Deno, so the
  support of `std/http` and `std/ws` have been removed. There is no way to
  "force" oak to use the Deno `std/http`.

- feat: remove deprecated fetchEventHandler (6749922)

  **BREAKING CHANGE**

  The `.fetchEventHandler()` used with Deno Deploy which was deprecated has been
  removed. Deploy users should invoke oak just like they were using oak in the
  Deno CLI.

- feat: add limit when getting a request body (34c179b)

  **BREAKING CHANGE**

  There is a default limit when reading a body to avoid DDOS attacks where a
  malicious client can send a body that is too large for the server to handle.
  To disable the feature, set the `limit` option when reading a body to `0` or
  `Infinity`.

- feat: mocked contexts provide the cookies property (#422)

  The testing utilities now allow cookies to be provided when creating a mock
  context.

- feat: infer RouteParam types (9cf12d0)

  **BREAKING CHANGE**

  When using the `Router()` and adding middleware, the types have been updated
  to infer the route params property of the context from the route provided.

  This means in certain situations where the route params were asserted by
  setting the generic value is no longer necessary and can actually cause type
  errors. Users should just remove explicit generic settings and instead allow
  the type to be inferred from the route string.

- feat: add ignoreInsecure when setting a cookie (16cdcc1)

  Users attempting to set secure cookies in what appears to be an insecure
  context can use the `ignoreInsecure` option when setting the cookie to
  suppress the error.

- fix: refactor `request.hasBody` and `request.body()` (b1e2921)

  In HTTP/2 many requests with a body would actually be set to a zero length
  body, since the body cannot be reliably determined until it is attempted to be
  read. As of Deno 1.16.1 this behavior is also reflected in HTTP/1.1 requests.
  This highlighted that `.hasBody` is not a reliable API, and code was
  refactored to handle this better, as well as handle zero length and undefined
  bodies in `request.body()`. When asserting a specific body type, and there is
  not a body present, a zero length body of the type requested is returned,
  previously this would have thrown. This means it is now always safe to request
  a specific body type from `request.body()`.

- fix: proxy middleware doesn't use global flag on regex (#429)
- fix: decode path as URL, not component (dd4c091)

  This fixed issues where path separators that are encoded in the path are not
  decoded, which is better aligned to expectations and other middleware
  frameworks.

- docs: fix typo in Middleware import (#426)
- docs: Improved readability for getting started section (#421)
- docs: simplify code example (#414)
- chore: update to Deno 1.16.1, std 0.114.0, media_types 2.11.0 (1a4e488)
- chore: re-enable code cov upload (14b61cc)
- chore: ignore lint rule (950cf48)
- chore: update router examples (8463c22)

## Version 9.0.1

- feat: rename logging errors to uncaught application errors (be0390c)

  For clarity, application errors are no longer labelled as coming from oak, but
  instead are labelled as uncaught application errors.

- fix: ensure can close the native server by closing open http connections
  (#389)
- fix: ensure code works with no check (6157784)
- fix: upgrading connection to WebSocket (#401)
- docs: fix typo in FAQs (#390)
- docs: fix typo in README (#395)
- chore: add jobs flag to tests in ci (50bbe52)
- chore: only generate lcov on linux on ci (b956357)
- chore: make `useUnknownInCatchVariables` type safe (6f680c9)
- chore: move ci to Deno 1.14.0

## Version 9.0.0

- **BREAKING CHANGE** refactor: move to web crypto for cookie signing (14c6b47)

  Use the web crypto APIs for cookie signing and validation instead of the Deno
  `std` library. This introduces a **breaking change** in that getting and
  setting cookies are now performed asynchronously due to async nature of the
  web crypto APIs. Both `.cookies.get()` and `.cookies.set()` return promises
  which should be awaited.

- feat: support request event interface for Deploy (2aadac6)

  Add support for the request event interface for Deno Deploy, which is the same
  API as the _native_ Deno CLI http server API. This means that Deploy
  applications are started in the same way as if they are one the CLI, likely
  meaning that there is no change to using oak when moving between Deno CLI and
  Deploy. Deploy users should just `await app.listen()` like they would with CLI
  applications.

  This also _deprecates_ the `app.fetchEventHandler()` method. The method will
  be removed in future version of oak.

- refactor: move to web crypto instead of std createHash (2156f76)

  The web crypto APIs are now used for internal purposes like creating etags and
  generating temporary directories.

- refactor: clean-up of logic in `HttpError` constructor (#381)
- fix: listen event occurs on listen and contains correct info (44ab231)

  The listen event would not be dispatched at the right time and potentially not
  contain correct information. This has been fixed.

- fix: range requests properly handle single last byte requests (#373)

  Fixes an edge case where range requests requesting a single last byte would
  fail.

- fix: issue with types when using dom libs (7fcc494)
- fix: allow streaming the request body multiple times (#384)
- fix: malformed request url doesn't cause uncaught error (046c732)
- fix: clear headers properly when uncaught error (83f0841)
- chore: add easy dev container support (5eb2177)

  The repository contains dev container information, making it easy to clone the
  repo on GitHub and have a development environment.

- chore: update to Deno 1.13.1, std 0.105.0, media_types 2.10.1 (bc9b82b)
- chore: update to dectyl 0.10.3 (bc81512)
- docs: update request body types documentation in readme (#383)
- docs: update information about cookies API (d08dce7)

## Version 8.0.0

- **BREAKING CHANGE** feat: add native request web socket support (9d1b770)

  The ability to upgrade Deno native HTTP requests is support by Deno 1.12 and
  later and has been integrated into oak.

  This also introduces a **breaking change**, where if using the `std` server
  with oak, the `ctx.upgrade()` will resolve with a web standard `WebSocket`
  interface, where previously it resolved with the non-standard `std` server
  interface.

- **BREAKING CHANGE** feat: options for the way state is create for a context
  (f360e3f)

  In oak v6 and prior, the context's `.state` was simply an alias to the
  application's `.state`. In v7, the context's `.state` was a clone of the
  application's `.state`. The problem was that not everything that could be
  assigned to the application's state was cloneable, leading to runtime errors
  when trying to handle requests.

  In v8, the default behavior is similar to v7, but non-clone-able properties of
  the applications `.state` are skipped. In addition, there is a new application
  option which can be passed up creating a new application named `contextState`
  which takes one of several values:

  - `"clone"` - this is the default behavior mentioned above.
  - `"alias"` - this is the behavior of oak v6 and prior, where the
    application's `.state` strictly equals the context's `.state`.
  - `"prototype"` - this creates a new `.state` for each context, using the
    application's `.state` as the prototype.
  - `"empty"` - a new empty object is created for each context's `.state`.

- feat: allow setting of an extension/content type map for send() (f8ee902)

  `send()` takes a new option of `contextTypes` which is a record of extensions
  and content types to use. This allows extending and overriding of the existing
  `media_types` database when serving files.

- feat: log uncaught errors by default (7669d12)

  While the application has emitted `"error"` events for quite a while, many
  users are not aware of how listen for errors. Therefore by default, the
  application will log to stderr any uncaught errors that occur within the
  application. This behavior can be turned off by setting the application option
  `logErrors` to `false` when creating a new application.

- fix(#352): fix content-length in Range requests (#353)

- fix(#362): handle errors occurring during finalizing response (7d39e1f)

  Previously, if there were issues finalizing the response, such as attempting
  to serialize to JSON the response's body, the error would be dispatched on the
  application, but a response would not be sent back to the client, just
  "hanging" the client. Now, an error response (500) should be sent back to the
  client.

- docs: update readme (6efacb1)
- chore: update to Deno 1.12.1, std 0.102.0, media_types 2.9.3 (4bc080c)
- chore: update vscode settings (f4138f9)

## Version 7.7.0

- feat: improve inspection/console logging (bfbf061)

  Most oak classes now utilise Deno's custom inspect API to provide better
  logging information.

- feat: SSE can send keep-alive comments (3d27096)

  When upgrading a connection to a server-sent-event target, the `keepAlive`
  option can be set to allow "polling" of the connection to keep it alive (as
  well as detect client disconnections without having to dispatch and event).

- fix(proxy): Retain original search parameters (#347)

  Search parameters in a proxied request are now forwarded.

- fix(#343): parse out unique set-cookie headers

  When setting multiple cookies in a response, adding additional cookies works
  properly.

- fix: SSEStreamTarget handles connections closing properly (0678104)

  When using SSE with the native HTTP, client connections closing will now
  trigger the `"close"` event properly.

- chore: change ci to Deno 1.11.2 (bbd5fe4)
- chore: restore lint comments until Deno 1.12 (93323c3)

## Version 7.6.3

## Version 7.6.0

- feat: improve support for Deno Deploy (2426ff2)

  Fix issues with parsing certain request fields when running under deploy.

- feat: add testing utilities (7baf73c)

  Add utilities for make testing oak middleware easier. See
  [Testing oak](https://oakserver.github.io/oak/testing) for more information.

- feat: proxy middleware (bbc7ab7)

  Add built in proxy middleware that makes it easier to do back to back proxy
  requests using Deno CLI or Deno Deploy.

- fix(#327): properly handle setting multiple cookies (275fe08)
- tests: fix response test fixture (5d66aa1)
- tests: async try catch throws (b6288d6)
- chore: refactor based on canary Deno updating to TS 4.3 (43d2699)
- chore: incorporate upcoming Deno changes (7a69a57)
- chore: update to Deno 1.11.1, std 0.99.0, media_types 2.9.0 (d9e5387)

## Version 7.5.0

- feat: allow overriding std/native HTTP servers (771e7b0)

  Exported `HttpSeverStd` and `HttpServerNative` to allow these to be supplied
  when creating the application by passing the `serverConstructor` option, as
  well as updated documentation around how to accomplish this.

- fix(#282): `router.redirect()` destination can be arbitrary URL (802435c)
- fix(#319): ensure that at least one middleware is present in types (29326ef)
- fix: upcoming TypeScript 4.3 changes (fe7ad3c)
- docs: add information about Deno Deploy (3faadda)

## Version 7.4.1

- chore: update to Deno 1.10.1, std 0.96.0, media_types 2.8.4

## Version 7.4.0

- feat: add range support for send() (#303)

  When using `.send()` oak announces support for ranges and is able to process
  the `Range` header along with `If-Range` header.

- feat: add support for nested routers (#275)

  Routers can now support "sub" or nested routers.

- fix: properly close native listener (a7e053c)
- fix: handle http connection errors (6d5f6d6)
- fix: `context.app.state` is properly typed (81fcefa)
- fix: setting response body to `null` or `undefined` returns 204 (af21480)
- fix: no response body is `null` or `undefined`, not falsy (1481508)
- refactor: allow non-void returns from middleware (b86f1da)
- chore: restore Deno 1.9.1 to CI (9696760)
- chore: Deno fmt updates (8398d6e)
- chore: add example nested routing server (0d4b5d8)

## Version 7.3.0

- feat: better handling of readable streams in response body (#301)

  Before, streams set as a body would always be assumed to be an Uint8Array
  readable stream. Now any readable stream set as the response body will be
  transformed automatically to an Uint8Array. In addition, when using the
  `std/http` version, readable streams were treated as async iterators, now they
  will be directly converted into a `Deno.Reader`.

- fix: Deno 1.9.1 breaking changes (2527604)
- fix: Deno 1.9.1 changes to native HTTP (0b8a7d8)
- fix: better support for native HTTPS (e6d3e72)
- chore: fix test cases for native request (8490b6f)
- chore: update to Deno 1.9.1, std 0.94.0, media_types 2.8.2 (78c0997)
- chore: revert to canary in CI until 1.9.1 available as action

## Version 7.2.0

Because one minor release a day isn't good enough and:

- feat: add app.fetchEventHandler() (#296)

  Add a method which provides everything needed for handling Deno Deploy's
  `FetchEvent`s.

## Version 7.1.0

- feat: enable server-sent events for native HTTP bindings (#293)

  Server-sent events now work on both the `std/http` and the native HTTP server
  with Deno.

- refactor: make connection optional for app.handle() (#294)

  This was required to support Deno Deploy.

- refactor: add fallback for structured clone when core unavailable (#295)

  This was also required to support Deno Deploy, as it currently doesn't expose
  the low level APIs required to do structured cloning.

## Version 7.0.0

- feat: context.state is cloned from app.state (1590ac9)

  This is also a **breaking change,** but in a way that is consistent with
  general expectations about how state works, in that `Context::state` is no
  longer global.

- feat: add etag support (2a38d15)

  The `etag.ts` module provides middleware and other tools to support `ETag`s.

- feat: `.send()` supports ETag and If-None-Match automatically (be80283)

  Using `.send()` to send files in responses will automatically handle setting
  and validating `ETag`s from clients to deal with determining if files have
  changed.

- feat: Support Deno's native HTTP server (59e7a00)

  As of Deno 1.9.0, Deno supports a _native_ HTTP server and now oak supports
  both the `std/http` server and the native one. It does this transparently to
  the user, so if the new native APIs are available, they will be used.

  Currently to have the APIs available, you have to start Deno with the
  `--unstable` flag.

- refactor: support native HTTP request on request body (96373ac)

  Using the `Request::body` is fully supported with the native HTTP server and
  because of this the request body type of `"stream"` is supported, which will
  return the body as a `ReadableStream<Uint8Array>`.

  This also makes a **breaking change** where the `"raw"` body type was renamed
  `"bytes"` to better reflect what is occurring.

  This also works around an issue with Deno where when reading the response
  body, the response fails.

- refactor: minor refactors and removal of deprecated Deno APIs (993efa7)
